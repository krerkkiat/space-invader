# Space Invader
An old project for CNC Lab (formerly known as WICOS Lab).

This project was being developed under the concept of learning new thing, which include version control, database, and server-client.

The database of server side part is accidentally destroyed while I was freeing up the hard drive space. Therefore, this is not funcional for now. An attept to restore the data will be performed later.
